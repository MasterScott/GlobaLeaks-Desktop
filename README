GlobaLeaks Desktop is a Whistleblowing Submission application for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux that provide built in Anonimity and Data encryption.

The application is a bundle of several technologies glued together:
 * Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) - https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en
 * Firefox PGP encryption plug-in - https://github.com/kylehuff/webpg-npapi
 * Customization to make everything well integrated,usable, pre-configurable (OEM) for interaction with a GlobaLeaks site


GL Desktop provide the following features:
 * Web Browser is secured (hardened Aurora from TBB
 * Anonimity is enforced trough the buse of Tor.
 * Data encryption can be enforced trough the use of client-side PGP encryption

Usability improvements
 * Start page asking the user to:
  * Insert a GlobaLeaks site hostname
  * Browse/select a GlobaLeaks site from LeakDirectory.org
  * If the GL-Desktop is pre-configured, directly load the pre-configured GL site interface
 * TBB Windows Installer Usability Improvement

Security improvements
 * Incorporate PGP Encryption trough NPAPI-based PGP plug-in
 * Strip down the browser functionality and user-interactions available: This browser is not for general browser but only for GlobaLeaks Submission use.

 * Whenever possible try to make major customizations (usability improvements & PGP Support) included into Tor Browser Bundle as a  default feature set
